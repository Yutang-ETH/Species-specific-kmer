# Species-specific-kmer

```
What I have done:
1. obtain shared k-mers from three Lolium multiflorum (L. m) haplotype-reoslved genome assemblies
2. obtain shared k-mers from three Lolium perenne (L. p) haplotype-reoslved genome assemblies
3. compare above two sets of k-mers to get L. m specific k-mers and L. p specific k-mers
4. count these L. m and L. p specific k-mers in 10 L. p genotypes and 25 L. m genotypes that have high coverage whole-genome short-read sequencing data
5. take the number of L. m specific k-mers as the x coordinate and the number of L. p specific k-mers as the y coordinate, visualize these genotypes. Clearly it can be seen that L. p and L. m genotypes are separated 
6. further obtain the common L. m specific k-mers found in all L. m genotypes, name this set as L. m specific core set
7. further obtain the common L. p specific k-mers found in all L. p genotypes, name this set as L. p specific core set
8. align L.m and L.p core sets to genome assembly Kyuss v2.0 (L. p) to find their positions in Kyuss genome
